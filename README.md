# MVC-homework2: Another Brick in the Wall

Yes, that's right, time to deal with another turd... I'd do anything were it not so, but I had such difficulty getting my file structure something resembling intelligible that it's embarrasing. In fact, I deleted 3 repos that were put together so wrongly... Frankly, I've no reason to assume that this is "right" in any case, as none of the scant parts I have amount to a functional anything! In any case, there were many commits to many other repos that aren't apparent in this one...!

I would like to point out that homework really suffers during these group projects...! Straddling 2 homework assignments at one time on a regular basis is, in my humble opinion, a solid and consistent adult dose of work. These weeks when we have team projects to build really takes it out of not only the time you get to spend on your task, but also your focus. I have to assume, though, that this might be something one can "look forward to more of" in the times ahead. Be that the case, there's one more thing for me to recallibrate my reaction to and relation with. I've proven I can do that, anyway...

Regarding this particular assignment, it's painfully clear to me that I have a lot more trouble with the projects that are built from scratch than the ones in which we are given starter code to modify... That is to say, I'm clearly more comfortable updating than creating. Add that to the list of things I need to grapple with!

Suffice it to say, I'm still not proud, but I'm still not done!
